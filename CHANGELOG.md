# Changelog

All notable changes to the Base Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v2.0.0] - 2025-01-31

### Added
- **Automatic Relationship Detection**: Enhanced code generation to automatically detect and create GORM relationships when field names end with `_id` and have `uint` type
- **Smart Field Processing**: Generator now creates both foreign key fields and relationship fields automatically without manual specification
- **Enhanced Templates**: Updated model, service, and request/response templates to handle auto-detected relationships properly
- **Clean Code Generation**: Eliminated duplicate field generation issues in templates
- **Proper GORM Tags**: Auto-generated relationships include correct `foreignKey` GORM tags
- **Template Consistency**: All templates now consistently handle the enhanced relationship detection system

### Changed
- **Model Template**: Updated to handle both foreign key and relationship fields generated by enhanced detection
- **Service Template**: Fixed to prevent duplicate field assignments in Create and Update operations
- **Field Processing Logic**: Enhanced `ProcessField` function in `templateutils.go` to detect `_id` suffix patterns and generate appropriate relationship structures
- **Template Logic**: Simplified template conditions to work with the new dual-field approach (foreign key + relationship)

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Fields**: Resolved issue where foreign key fields were being generated multiple times in models
- **Service Layer**: Fixed Create and Update methods to properly handle auto-detected relationship fields
- **Template Rendering**: Corrected template logic to avoid conflicts between manual and automatic relationship handling
- **Init.go Cleanup**: Previously fixed issue where destroy command wasn't properly cleaning up module registrations
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Previously corrected status codes in generated controllers
- **Directory Naming**: Previously fixed to use plural directory names (`models`, `posts`) with singular model files

### Technical Details
- Enhanced `ProcessField` function to return multiple `FieldStruct` objects when detecting `_id` patterns
- Updated all templates to distinguish between regular fields and relationship fields
- Improved GORM tag generation for automatic foreign key relationships
- Streamlined template logic to reduce complexity and improve maintainability

### Examples

Before this enhancement, you needed to manually specify relationships:
```bash
base g article title:string content:text author:belongsTo:Author category:belongsTo:Category
```

Now, relationships are automatically detected:
```bash
base g article title:string content:text author_id:uint category_id:uint
```

This automatically generates:
```go
type Article struct {
    Id         uint     `json:"id" gorm:"primarykey"`
    Title      string   `json:"title"`
    Content    string   `json:"content"`
    AuthorId   uint     `json:"author_id"`
    Author     Author   `json:"author,omitempty" gorm:"foreignKey:AuthorId"`
    CategoryId uint     `json:"category_id"`
    Category   Category `json:"category,omitempty" gorm:"foreignKey:CategoryId"`
}
```

### Migration Guide
- Existing models and modules continue to work without changes
- New modules can take advantage of automatic relationship detection by using the `_id` suffix convention
- No breaking changes to existing CLI commands or API
